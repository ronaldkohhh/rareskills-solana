# 60 Days of Solana - A course by Rareskills

Solana Course

MODULE 1

Introductory Topics
Day 1
Hello World (and troubleshooting Solana installation)

Day 2
 Function arguments, math, and arithmetic overflow

Day 3
Anchor function magic and the Interface Definition Language

Day 4
Solana reverts, errors, and basic access control

Day 5
Where is the constructor? About anchor deploy

MODULE 2
The minimum Rust you need to know
Day 8-10 are not critical, they only explain some syntax which is likely unfamiliar to most readers. However, you can write Solana programs and follow along while treating the unusual syntax as boilerplate. Feel free to skim over those days.

Day 6
Solidity Translations to Rust and Solana

Day 7
The unusual syntax of Rust

Day 8
Understanding function-like macros in Rust

Day 9
Rust Structs and Attribute-like and Custom Derive Macros

Day 10
Translating Solidity function visibility and contract inheritance to Solana

MODULE 3
Important System-level Information in Solana
Day 11
Block variables in Solana: block.timestamp and block.number and others

Day 12
Beyond the block: sysvars

Day 13
Solana logs, events, and transaction history

Day 14
tx.origin, msg.sender, and onlyOwner in Solana

Day 15
Transaction fees and compute units

MODULE 4
Accounts and Storage in Solana
Accounts are one of the most complicated topics in Solana development because they are considerably more flexible than Ethereum storage variables., so we go over them slowly. Each tutorial will progressively reinforce concepts, so don’t worry if all the new information doesn’t stick right away.

Day 16
Accounts in Solana

Day 17
Writing to storage

Day 18
Reading Accounts from Typescript — an alternative to public variables and view functions

Day 19
Creating mappings and nested mappings in Solana

Day 20
Cost of storage, maximum storage size, and account resizing

Day 21
Reading an account balance in Rust: address(account).balance in Solana

Day 22
More differences: modifiers, view pure, payable, and fallback in Solana

Day 23
Building a payment splitter: “payable” and “msg.value” in Solana

Day 24
Authorizing various wallets to write to an account: "Pranking tx.origin"

Day 25
PDA vs Keypair Accounts

Day 26
Understanding Account Ownership in Solana: Transferring SOL out of a PDA

Day 27
init_if_needed and the Reinitialization Attack

Day 28
Multicall in Solana: Batching Transactions
